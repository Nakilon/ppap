# Introduction

pPAP is a functional prediction tool for plant type III polyketide synthases (PKSs). [1]
The predicted functions are represented by "reaction types" defined by Shimizu et al. [2]
The reaction types consist of three features of reactions catalyzed by the PKSs:

(i) the starter substrate
(ii) extended structure of the polyketide intermediate
(iii) intramolecular cyclization

pPAP assigns each sequence of a query to one of four reaction types: R-4-A, R-4-C, R-2-X, or other.


# Reaction types used in pPAP

Reaction type:	R-4-A
Definition:	Ring-starter	4 methylenecarbonyl units in the intermediate	aldol cyclizaiton
Example of PKSs:	Stilebene synthase, Biphenyl synthase, and Bibenzyl synthase
Example of products:	Resveratrol, 3,5-Dihydroxybiphenyl, and 3,3',5-Trihydroxybibenzyl

Reaction type:	R-4-C
Definition:	Ring-starter	4 methylenecarbonyl units in the intermediate	Claisen cyclizaiton
Example of PKSs:	Chalcone synthase, Benzophenone synthase, and Homoeriodictyol/eriodictyol synthase
Example of products:	Naringenin chalcone, 2,4,6-Trihydroxybenzophenone, and Homoeriodictyol/eriodictyol

Reaction type:	R-2-X
Definition:	Ring-starter	2 methylenecarbonyl units in the intermediate	no cyclizaiton
Example of PKSs:	Benzalacetone synthase, Diketide-CoA synthase, and Curcumin synthase
Example of products:	p-Hydroxybenzalacetone, Feruloyldiketide-CoA, and Curcumin

Reaction type:	Other
Definition:	Other types than R-4-A, R-4-C, and R-2-X (e.g., Rn-4-Cn, Sb-4-C, Sc-7-A+, L-4-A, and etc.)
Example of PKSs:	Acridone synthase, Phlorisovalerophenone synthase, Aloesone synthase, Alkylresorcinol synthase, and etc.
Example of products:	1,3-Dihydroxy-N-methylacridone, Phlorisovalerophenone, Aloesone, Tetraketide alkylresorcinol, and etc.


# macOS installation and usage

$ brew install mafft hmmer
$ # gem install bundler -v 1.17.3   # for Ruby 1.9.3
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby ppap.rb some.fas


# Requirement

pPAP is written in Ruby language.
This tool is intended for use on a Linux operating system and requires the following programs:

ruby >= 1.9.3	# Ruby language
bioruby >= 1.5.0	# Bioinformatics library for Ruby
mafft >= 7.270	# Multiple sequence alignment program
hmmer >= 3.1b2	# Analysis using profile hidden Markov models


# Set up

Install all the requisite programs and set PATH so that your shell can use them.

Extract the archive file "ppap.tar.gz"
% tar zxfv ppap.tar.gz

Then, the following directories and files will be created:

ppap/
  ppap.rb	# Main program
  calculate_score_correlated_res_pair_ACX.rb	# Script for calculating correlation scores
  calculate_score_hmm_ACX.rb	# Script for calculating HMM scores
  LICENSE	# GNU GPL License Version 3
  README	# This file
ppap/data/	# Directory including 15 data files


# Usage

% ruby ppap.rb FASTA_FILE

FASTA_FILE: a query amino acid sequence file in (multi) FASTA format.
